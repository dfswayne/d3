Kenny and I are each creating a git repository that
we can use to our own experiments, and to make them available
to one another.

1. If you don't have a login at github.com, get one.
  
2. Download and install the latest version of git

https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
   I haven't done any of the password stuff, so I will
   have to type my login and password each time I upload
   code.

Executed this:
git config --global user.email "dfswayne@gmail.com"


Now we're creating repositories
  dfswayne/d3
  kshirley/d3practice

There were some choices to be made in this process: We created our
repositories to be public and we're initializing README files.

I now have a repository at this url:
  https://github.com/dfswayne/d3.git

So I can clone it:

   git clone  https://github.com/dfswayne/d3.git

That created a directory on my laptop named d3.  It has one
file so far, the README.md file containing my description of the
repository.

---

We then looked for a while at the code for the Baseball Player
visualization that Carlos wrote, but it's way too complicated.
We definitely want to start with the simplest tutorials we can
find.


There are quite a few talks and tutorials on mbostock.github.com/d3,
like this one:

http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/bar-1.html 

or this one:

http://bl.ocks.org/3887118   ---  one scatterplot of the iris
  data, colored by variety.

I grabbed copies of the data and the html code from the second
example and put them in my own d3 directory, named iris.html and
iris.tsv.  (I had to edit iris.html to reflect that I had renamed
the data file.)  If I open iris.html in a browser, I immediately
see the same plot that I see in the web examples.

Note that I have not yet downloaded a copy of d3.js, but that
I'm using it over the web.  Carlos says that, as an application
is shared with more users and gets more hits, it would be more polite
to run your own server and have your own copy of d3, but I don't
think I need to do that just yet.

---

If we need to create a local server, like if we're having trouble
reading our data, instructions are here:

github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki

I don't feel the need to do that yet, either.

---

git add iris.html
git add iris.tsv
git commit
git push 

And that uploaded those two files to my git repository, so that you
can clone my repository and run that example yourself.
